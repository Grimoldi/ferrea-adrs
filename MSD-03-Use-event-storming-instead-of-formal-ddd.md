# MSD-03: Use Event Storming Instead of Formal DDD

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want to try to reason more about my microservice, instead of writing them down on the fly.

DDD (Domain Driven Design) should be the choices, but it's indeed too much for a small project like this, with only myself doing it as a personal project.

## Decision

Instead of using DDD, I'll use [Event Storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/).

## Consequences

I'll use [Figma](www.figma.com) to design it online.

Disclaimer: I'm not related to Figma, it's just the first tool found on Google that supports Event Storming.

# INF-02: Kubernetes cluster

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want to use a kubernetes cluster to orchestrate my microservice.

Being this a personal/hobby project, I don't want to spend money since I don't know when I will find the time to go on.

## Decision

I'll use an OSS Kubernetes, [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).

## Consequences

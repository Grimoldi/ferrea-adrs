# OPM-01: Decision Tracking

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want to keep track of the key decisions made in the Ferrea project, so that I know which decisions to re-consider in future builds.

## Decision

Use Michael Nygard's Lightweight Architectural Decision Record format to log key decisions.

Manage the decision records as code and maintain a git repository to manage access and changes to them.

## Consequences

The decision record will become an important part of the system documentation. It will need to be continually maintained as new decisions are made and old decisions change to avoid drift.
